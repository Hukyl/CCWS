Clockify - ComindWork Synchronization is a Go web app that synchronizes time logs between different services and allows for simple visualizations.

The goal of this app is to develop a useful piece of software while practicing the following skills:

1. Golang and gRPC
1. Software design and architecture (by GRASP from "Applying UML and Patterns")
1. Data visualizations (by guidelines from completed courses in university)
1. React
1. Developing projects from scratch without the use of frameworks

More on the project idea and vision is described in the [Inception](docs/inception.md).

More on the user flows is described in the [Use Cases](docs/use-cases.md).
